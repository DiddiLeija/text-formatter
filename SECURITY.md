## Supported Versions

Here's a list of all the versions to be released on PyPI.

Those versions with a :white_check_mark: are supported, maybe they are stable or being developed right now. 
Those with a :warning: are still being stable, but will be deprecated or even yanked in the future. And those with an :x:
are no longer supported or hasn't been released yet. Those versions with a :grey_question: are in development, and only
accept enhancement proposals, not bug reports.

| Version | Supported          | Status          |
