This is the tracking issue for version `(version)` of **text\_formatter**.

## Release process jobs:

- [ ] Make GitHub release and tag
- [ ] Upload package to http://pypi.org/project/text_formatter
- [ ] Make note on project [`text_formatter - Project board`](https://github.com/users/DiddiLeija/projects/4#column-14845989)


<!----------------------------
On the title, don't keep the "[$version]",
PLEASE! Use the real version (or the due date)
to replace it.

Good titles for these issues:

"[$version] release"
"[$due date] release"
------------------------------>
