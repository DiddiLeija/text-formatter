Contributing on ``text_formatter``
==================================

This is an open-source project, so we accept
contributions, and we appreciate it a lot.

Collaborate on the code
-----------------------

We are hosting the ``text_formatter`` code on `GitHub <https://github.com/DiddiLeija/text_formatter/>`_. That supports
many ways for contributing.

Fork the repository and contribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To propose changes to the code, you can `fork the GitHub repository <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#about-forks>`_, and
then push commits to a branch. After that, you can open a `pull request <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#about-pull-requests>`_
on the original repository. That pull request could close an open issue, or add a new feature.

After you submit a pull request, the project maintainers will review the code to decide if your suggestion will
be applied.

Participate on issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like most of the projects, we have enabled the `GitHub issues <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues#quickly-create-issues>`_. Use
them to report an unexpected behaviour or a feature request.

We have also created issue templates to ease the issue creation. The templates made for any users are:

* **Bug report**: Create a report to help us improve
* **Feature request**: Suggest an idea for this project
* **Security vulnerability issue**: An issue about a security vulnerability

.. note::

   In most of the cases, you don't have to open issues with the ``Security vulnerability issue`` template.

.. warning::

   We created the issue templates to make an easier diagnose of bug reports and feature requests. Please provide *all the information requested*
   that applies on your case.
   
   If we see invalid issues, we'll request for more information by using a ``no-response`` bot [#f1]_, but if you don't give us
   complete information, the bot will close the issue.

.. warning::

   We have more issue templates, but they were made for the project maintainers (like release trackers and other things). If you are
   not a maintainer of ``text_formatter``, *please don't open that kind of issues*. We'll ignore those special issues if they were created
   without permission.

Contributions to documentation
------------------------------

Since we are saving the documentation files on the same repository than the code, the same things apply for
contributing to the documentation.

Maintainers of the code
-----------------------

At this moment, ``text_formatter`` is maintained and owned by `Diego Ramirez <http://github.com/DiddiLeija>`_.
