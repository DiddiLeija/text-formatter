How do we handle issues on our GitHub repository
================================================

We use `GitHub issues <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues#quickly-create-issues>`_ to
track bugs, requests and other important jobs. This document talks about our issues, labels, and templates.

Labels
------

We have labels to identify what does the issue tries to do.

Markdown templates
------------------

We have created issue templates to ease the issue creation. The templates made for any users are:

* **Bug report**: Create a report to help us improve
* **Feature request**: Suggest an idea for this project
* **Security vulnerability issue**: An issue about a security vulnerability

.. note::

   In most of the cases, you don't have to open issues with the ``Security vulnerability issue`` template.

.. warning::

   We created the issue templates to make an easier diagnose of bug reports and feature requests. Please provide *all the information requested*
   that applies on your case.
   
   If we see invalid issues, we'll request for more information by using a ``no-response`` bot [#f1]_, but if you don't give us
   complete information, the bot will close the issue.

.. warning::

   We have more issue templates, but they were made for the project maintainers (like release trackers and other things). If you are
   not a maintainer of ``text_formatter``, *please don't open that kind of issues*. We'll ignore those special issues if they were created
   without permission.
